## Requirements
You need pytorch library to run the code.You can use Jupyter notebook or Google Colab
## Details
Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) are the most basic type of artificial neural networks, consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the input data, and the output layer produces the desired output. The hidden layers perform the processing of the input data by applying non-linear transformations to the input signals\
FFNNs are a powerful tool in the field of Deep learning, and their versatility and ability to approximate any function make them a valuable asset in many different field
## Running the code
1.Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed on your computer. If not, install it using pip install jupyterlab\
2.Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your .ipynb file is located.\
3.Type jupyter notebook and press Enter.\
4.This should open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.\
5.Click on the .ipynb file you want to run.
